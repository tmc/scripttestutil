# Example test demonstrating the expect command set
# This test shows how to interact with an interactive program (python)

# Start a Python interpreter
expect:spawn python3
expect:expect ">>>" 5

# Run a simple calculation
expect:send "print(40 + 2)"
expect:expect "42" 5
expect:expect ">>>" 5

# Try some more complex interaction
expect:send "import os"
expect:expect ">>>" 5

expect:send "os.getcwd()"
expect:expect ">>>" 5

# Create a simple function 
expect:send "def greet(name):"
expect:expect "..." 5
expect:send "    print(f'Hello, {name}!')"
expect:expect ">>>" 5

# Test the function
expect:send "greet('World')"
expect:expect "Hello, World!" 5

# Exit the Python interpreter
expect:send "exit()"

# Verify test completion
echo "Expect example test completed successfully"
stdout "Expect example test completed successfully"
