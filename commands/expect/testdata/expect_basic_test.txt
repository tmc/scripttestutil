# Basic test for expect commands
# Tests interaction with the Python interpreter

# Spawn a Python interpreter
expect:spawn python3
expect:expect ">>>" 5

# Send a simple print command
expect:send "print('Hello from expect test')"
expect:expect "Hello from expect test" 5

# Test multiple commands
expect:send "import sys"

expect:script '
spawn python3
expect ">>>"
send "print(2 + 2)\\r"
expect "4"
expect ">>>"
send "exit()\\r"
expect eof
