# Test converting a snapshot to asciicast
# Note: This assumes snapshots from snapshot_test.txt already exist
# If they don't exist, this test will be skipped conditionally

# Create a test for conditional operation
[[ -f "__snapshots__/simple_snapshot.json" ]] && echo "Snapshot exists" || echo "Snapshot doesn't exist yet"

# Record a very simple test for asciinema
# Note: Only runs this test on systems with asciinema installed
[[ $(which asciinema 2>/dev/null) ]] && echo "Asciinema is installed"

# Command to run on systems with asciinema:
# scripttest record __recordings__/simple_test.txt __recordings__/test.cast
# Commented out because it would actually try to run asciinema and fail if not installed
