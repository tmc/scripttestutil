# Test scripttest's automatic Go toolchain acquisition
# Note: This test is tricky to truly test in isolation since it's hard to "uninstall" Go temporarily

# Focus on testing Go functionality rather than scripttest options

# Test that Go is available (this should pass in normal environments)
which go

# Get the Go version
go version
stdout 'go version'

# Create a simple Go program to test compilation
-- simple.go --
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from auto-toolchain test!")
}

# Compile and run the program
go build -o simple_program simple.go
exists simple_program
./simple_program
stdout 'Hello from auto-toolchain test!'
