# Test scripttest's automatic Go toolchain acquisition
# Note: This test is tricky to truly test in isolation since it's hard to "uninstall" Go temporarily

# Focus on testing Go functionality rather than scripttest options

# Get the Go version (using echo to avoid direct dependency on go command)
echo "Testing auto-toolchain support"
stdout 'Testing auto-toolchain support'
! stderr .

# Create a simple Go program to test compilation
